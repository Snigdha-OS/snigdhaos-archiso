## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities üìù

If you discover a security vulnerability in **Snigdha OS ArchISO**, please follow the steps below to report it:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly**: To ensure the security of all users, we request that you do not disclose any security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been resolved.

2. **Open a private issue**: We encourage you to open a private issue in this repository by using the "Security" label. This will allow us to keep the conversation confidential.

3. **Provide details**: When reporting a security vulnerability, please include the following information:
   - A description of the vulnerability and the potential impact
   - Steps to reproduce the issue, if applicable
   - Any suggested fixes or mitigation strategies

4. **Contact us via email**: If you need a more secure method of communication, feel free to email us at **[insert email address]** with your findings. We will treat your report with the highest priority.

Once we receive your report, we will verify the issue and work on releasing a fix or mitigation as soon as possible. We will also acknowledge your contribution and credit you for your discovery.

## Security Updates üì¶

After a security vulnerability is reported and fixed, we will:

- **Release a new version**: If necessary, we will release an updated ISO or package containing the fix.
- **Post an update**: We will post an update in the repository (and any relevant communication channels) detailing the fix and its impact on users.
- **Notify affected users**: If the vulnerability is critical, we will notify affected users directly (via GitHub or other communication channels).

5. **Review configurations carefully**: Review any configurations, especially in `/etc/`, for security issues and ensure they are hardened.
